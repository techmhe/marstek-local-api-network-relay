A **custom Home Assistant integration** for monitoring and controlling Marstek energy storage devices (Venus A/D/E 3.0, etc.) using **local UDP communication** via the Marstek Open API.

> **Note**: This is an independent community project and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Marstek**. This integration was originally inspired by Marstek's reference implementation but has been completely rewritten with a custom architecture, UDP client, and feature set.

## Features

### Monitoring
- **Battery State of Charge (SoC)** - Current battery level percentage
- **Battery Power** - Real-time charge/discharge power (W)
- **Battery Temperature** - Battery pack temperature
- **Battery Status** - Current operational status
- **Operating Mode** - Current device mode (Auto, AI, Manual, Passive)
- **PV Metrics** - Solar panel power, voltage, current, and state (up to 4 channels; Venus A/D)
- **On-grid Power** - Total grid power from energy meter (3-phase support)
- **WiFi Signal Strength** - RSSI for connectivity diagnostics
- **CT Connection Status** - Current transformer connection state
- **Device Information** - IP address, firmware version, MAC addresses

### Control
- **Operating Mode Selection** - Switch between Auto, AI, Manual, and Passive modes
- **Passive Mode Control** - Set charge/discharge power with duration (service)
- **Manual Scheduling** - Configure up to 10 time-based charge/discharge schedules
- **Bulk Schedule Management** - Set multiple schedules via YAML or clear all schedules
- **Data Sync** - Trigger immediate device refresh on demand

### Architecture
- **Local UDP Communication** - No cloud dependency, fast and reliable
- **Automatic IP Discovery** - Finds devices via UDP broadcast
- **Dynamic IP Handling** - Background scanner detects and updates IP changes
- **Centralized Polling** - Single coordinator per device to avoid request bursts
- **Stable Entity IDs** - BLE-MAC-based identifiers survive IP changes

## Comparison with other community integrations

| Integration | Repository | Summary | Strengths | Tradeoffs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **This integration** | https://github.com/taurgis/has-marstek-local-api | Local UDP with centralized polling, scanner-based IP updates, strong HA patterns. | Shared UDP client, tiered polling, robust config flow/options/services, strict validation & typing. | Focused on per-device setup (no multi-device aggregation). |
| **Marstek Local API** | https://github.com/jaapp/ha-marstek-local-api | Feature-rich local API integration with multi-device aggregation. | Multi-device support, aggregate sensors, extensive diagnostics. | Heavier complexity; discovery may pause active clients. |
| **MarstekEnergy reference** | https://github.com/marstekEnergy/ha_marstek | Vendor reference implementation. | Simple setup, uses upstream py-marstek. | Less robust networking (per-entry sockets), fewer HA best-practice patterns. |

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version/Details |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Home Assistant | Core 2025.10.0+ |
| Network | Same LAN segment as Marstek devices |
| Device Config | **OPEN API must be enabled** in the Marstek app |
| UDP Port | 30000 (default, must be reachable) |

> **Warning**: This integration is currently **not compatible with Venus E2.0** devices. Using this integration with Venus E2.0 may cause disconnection between the device and CT003.

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots menu and select **Custom repositories**
3. Add repository URL and select **Integration** as category
4. Search for "Marstek" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `custom_components/marstek` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

```bash
# Example for Home Assistant OS/Supervised
cd /config
mkdir -p custom_components
cp -r /path/to/ha_marstek/custom_components/marstek custom_components/
```

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** then **Devices and Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Marstek**
4. The integration will automatically discover devices on your network
5. Select your device and complete the setup

### Options

After setup, you can adjust polling and request behavior in **Device → Configure**:

- **Fast polling interval** (default: 30s): ES.GetMode, ES.GetStatus, EM.GetStatus (real-time power)
- **Medium polling interval** (default: 60s): PV.GetStatus (solar data, Venus A/D only)
- **Slow polling interval** (default: 300s): Wifi.GetStatus, Bat.GetStatus (diagnostics)
- **Request delay** (default: 10s): Delay between consecutive UDP requests
- **Request timeout** (default: 10s): Per-request timeout before retry/fail
- **Failures before unavailable** (default: 3): Consecutive failures before entities become unavailable

These values can be tuned to reduce network traffic or improve responsiveness.

### Data updates

The integration uses a single `DataUpdateCoordinator` per device with tiered polling to avoid request bursts. Entities never perform their own I/O and always read from coordinator data.

## Supported Devices

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Venus A 3.0 | Supported (PV supported) |
| Venus D 3.0 | Supported (PV supported) |
| Venus E 3.0 | Supported |
| Venus E 2.0 | Not compatible |
| Other OPEN API devices | May work (untested) |

## Services

The integration provides several services for advanced control:

### marstek.set_passive_mode
Set the device to passive mode with specified power and duration.
- **power**: Target power in watts (-5000 to 5000). Negative charges, positive discharges.
- **duration**: Duration in seconds (default: 3600)

### marstek.set_manual_schedule
Configure a single manual schedule slot.
- **schedule_slot**: Slot number (0-9)
- **start_time**: Schedule start time
- **end_time**: Schedule end time
- **power**: Target power in watts
- **days**: Days of the week (mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun)
- **enable**: Enable/disable the schedule

### marstek.set_manual_schedules
Configure multiple schedules via YAML:
```yaml
service: marstek.set_manual_schedules
data:
  device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID
  schedules:
    - schedule_slot: 0
      start_time: "08:00"
      end_time: "16:00"
      days: ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"]
      power: -2000
      enable: true
    - schedule_slot: 1
      start_time: "18:00"
      end_time: "22:00"
      power: 800
```

### marstek.clear_manual_schedules
Clear all manual schedule slots on the device.

### marstek.request_data_sync
Trigger an immediate data refresh from the device.

### Mock Device

A mock device is available for testing without physical hardware:

```bash
cd tools/mock_device
python mock_marstek.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
- Ensure OPEN API is enabled in the Marstek app on your device
- Verify Home Assistant and device are on the same network segment
- Check that UDP port 30000 is not blocked by firewall
- Try restarting the device

### Connection Issues
- The integration uses UDP which may be affected by network instability
- Check WiFi signal strength (RSSI sensor) for connectivity quality
- Ensure only one client is communicating with the device at a time

### Entities Unavailable
- Check device connectivity and OPEN API status
- Review Home Assistant logs for error messages
- Try the request_data_sync service
